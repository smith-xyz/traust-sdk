// RepoScopePath — Controlled pseudo-paths for findings about the repository itself rather than any artifact in it. A finding's identity derives from where it lives (ledger fingerprint = repo | sorted paths | primary CWE), so a location of '.' or '/' produces an empty path set and collapses identity to (repo, ”, cwe) — e.g. 'no SECURITY.md' and 'not onboarded to OpenSSF Scorecard' in one repo become one identity. Most such findings do have an artifact — an absent SECURITY.md is still SECURITY.md, and a missing file's path is a stable key that also tells a remediator what to create. These values exist only for the residue that genuinely has no artifact, e.g. 'repository appears unmaintained'. Prefer a real path; reach for these only when there is none.
